<h1>on ($sailsBind.on.html)</h1>
<p>Capture a given module event.  If $sailsBind.config({broadcastType: "simple"}) is set then this
is the only way to capture module events (including errors).  If a broadcastType of 'model' or both
is set then events are broadcast on the $rootScope.  Turning rootScope broadcast off isgood practice
as dependancies are obvious and events are only dispached to listener, which need to hear.</p>
